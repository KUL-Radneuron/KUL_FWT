# Changelog

## Unreleased (working tree, 2026-07-09, batch 2 — wishlist item 5)

- `KUL_FWT_make_TCKs.sh`: added an experimental, **opt-in only** `-U` flag.
  When given, and if `KUL_dwiprep.sh` has produced
  `response/lore_sd/rfa_modulated_fod_reg2T1w.mif` (odf .* rfa contrast,
  see `KUL_NIS` changelog), that FOD is preferred over the plain lore_sd
  ODF for tractography (same `-cutoff 0.05` as plain lore_sd). Without
  `-U`, behavior is byte-for-byte unchanged — plain lore_sd ODF is still
  auto-preferred over dhollander CSD FOD exactly as before.
- `KUL_FWT_make_TCKs_4Temp.sh` was **not** touched for this — it has no
  lore_sd awareness at all (only plain dhollander/template FOD), so adding
  the rfa-modulated preference there would mean building lore_sd support
  from scratch, which is out of scope for this item.

## Unreleased (working tree, 2026-07-09)

- `KUL_FWT_make_TCKs.sh` / `KUL_FWT_make_TCKs_4Temp.sh`: `tckgen` maximum
  turning angle bumped from 45 to 60 degrees, applied consistently across
  every `-angle` occurrence in both files (live bundle-tracking commands,
  the whole-brain tractogram commands, and the commented-out variants).
  No other logic changed.
