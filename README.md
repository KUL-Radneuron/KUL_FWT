# KUL_FWT

Automated subject specific parcellation-based tractography generated using MRTrix3.

Fun with tracts (FWT) employs automated tractography using MRTrix3 (Tournier et al., 2019, p. 3) v3.0.2, which is constrained by a selection of grey matter and WM 3D VOIs/parcels used to create “inclusion” and “exclusion” areas, based on the neuroanatomical literature. These VOIs/parcels are obtained from FreeSurfer (Fischl, 2012) v6 (FS), the Multi-Scale Brain Parcellator (Tourbier et al., 2019) v1.1.1 (MSBP), and several apriori atlases (see supplementary materials for details), along with custom VOIs manually defined in template space (the anterior commissure midline, and posterior commissure VOIs), and other custom VOIs that are generated by label propagation, (e.g., subsegmentation of the periventricular white matter, temporal stem, insula, and superior temporal gyrus subcortical white matter). Streamlines filtering is done using ScilPy (Bore et al., 2021; “Scilpy documentation,” 2021) v.1.1.0 and DIPY (Garyfallidis et al., 2014) tools and v1.3.0 for all bundles except the optic radiations for which we used the fiber-to-Bundle Coherence tool in DIPY (Garyfallidis et al., 2014) v1.3.0. FWT can be used for individual bundle tractography or whole brain tractography followed by streamlines segmentation. 

The KUL_FWT repo contains 2 main workflows for individual datasets: 
    - The first is called KUL_FWT_make_VOIs.sh is responsible for the automated generation of all data preparation, and inclusion and exclusion VOIs from the FreeSurfer and MSBP parcellations, and the preprocessed diffusion data.
    - The second is called KUL_FWT_make_TCKs.sh is responsible for the automated generation of all tractograms, and streamline filtering, using the output from KUL_FWT_make_VOIs.sh

Equivalent workflows are also provided for group-averaged template data (T1 and FOD), as described in *our manuscript*. These are called KUL_FWT_make_VOIs_4Temp.sh and KUL_FWT_make_TCKs_4Temp.sh

Below are the user instructions for each workflow

## KUL_FWT_make_VOIs.sh generates all inclusion and exclusion VOIs for fully automated fiber tractography according to an input config file

    Usage:

    KUL_FWT_make_VOIs.sh -p pat001 -s 01  -F /path_to/FS_dir/aparc+aseg.mgz -M /path_to/MSBP_dir/sub-pat001_label-L2018_desc-scale3_atlas.nii.gz -d /path_to/dMRI_dir -c /path_to/KUL_FWT_tracks_list.txt -o /fullpath/output

    Purpose:

    This workflow generates the VOIs needed for fiber tracking by KUL_FWT_make_TCKs.sh from input FS and MSBP for all bundles specified in the input config file for single subject data

    Required arguments:

    -M:  full path and file name of scale 3 MSBP parcellation
    -F:  full path and file name of aparc+aseg.mgz from FreeSurfer
    -c:  path to config file with list of tracks to segment from the whole brain tractogram
    -d:  path to directory with diffusion data (specific to subject and run)
    -o:  full path to output dir (if not set reverts to default output ./sub-*_ses-*_KUL_FWT_output)

    Optional arguments:

    -n:  number of cpu for parallelisation (default is 6)
    -h:  prints help menu

## KUL_FWT_make_TCKs.sh part of the KUL_FWT package of fully automated workflows for fiber tracking

    Usage:

    KUL_FWT_make_TCKs.sh -p pat001 -s 01  -F /path_to/FS_dir/aparc+aseg.mgz -M /path_to/MSBP_dir/sub-pat001_label-L2018_desc-scale3_atlas.nii.gz -d /path_to/dMRI_dir -c /path_to/KUL_FWT_tracks_list.txt -o /fullpath/output -T 2 -f 2
